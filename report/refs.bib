@article{a_panait_ant_2004,
	title = {Ant foraging revisited},
	abstract = {Most previous artificial ant foraging algorithms have to date relied to some degree on a priori knowledge of the environ-ment, in the form of explicit gradients generated by the nest, by hard-coding the nest location in an easily-discoverable place, or by imbuing the artificial ants with the knowledge of the nest direction. In contrast, the work presented solves ant foraging problems using two pheromones, one applied when searching for food and the other when returning food items to the nest. This replaces the need to use complicated nest-discovery devices with simpler mechanisms based on pheromone information, which in turn reduces the ant sys-tem complexity. The resulting algorithm is orthogonal and simple, yet ants are able to establish increasingly efficient trails from the nest to the food in the presence of obstacles. The algorithm replaces the blind addition of new amounts of pheromones with an adjustment mechanism that resembles dynamic programming.},

	abstract = {Swarm intelligence is a relatively new approach to problem solving that takes inspiration from the social behaviors of insects and of other animals. In particular, ants have inspired a number of methods and techniques among which the most studied and the most successful is the general purpose optimization technique known as ant colony optimization. Ant colony optimization (ACO) takes inspiration from the foraging behavior of some ant species. These ants deposit pheromone on the ground in order to mark some favorable path that should be followed by other members of the colony. Ant colony optimization exploits a similar mechanism for solving optimization problems. From the early nineties, when the first ant colony optimization algorithm was proposed, ACO attracted the attention of increasing numbers of researchers and many successful applications are now available. Moreover, a substantial corpus of theoretical results is becoming available that provides useful guidelines to researchers and practitioners in further applications of ACO. The goal of this article is to introduce ant colony optimization and to survey its most notable applications},

The first is an optimized implementation of ACO, by which the running time of ants routing is largely reduced. The results of the simulated experiments show that the improved algorithm not only reduces the number of routing in the ACO but also surpasses existing algorithms in performance in solving large-scale TSP problems. In the second improvement, we introduce individual variation to ACO, by which the ants have different routing strategies. Simulation results show that the speed of convergence of ACO algorithm could be enhanced greatly.},

The ant responses when temporarily blocking the access to some branches of the maze were observed in order to study which factors influenced their local decisions about the paths to follow. We present a mathematical model based on experimental observations that simulates the motion of ants through the network. In this model, ants communicate through the deposition of a trail pheromone that attracts other ants. In addition to the trail laying/following process, several other aspects of ant behavior were modeled. The paths selected by ants in the simulations were compared to those selected by ants in the experiments. The results of the model were encouraging, indicating that the same behavioral rules can lead ants to find the shortest paths under different environmental conditions.},

@article{a_panait_learning_2018,
	title = {Learning ant foraging behaviors},
	abstract = {Insects are good at cooperatively solving many complex tasks. For example, foraging for food far away from a nest can be solved through relatively simple behaviors in combi-nation with pheromones. As task complexity increases, how-ever, it may become difficult to find individual agent rules which yield a desired emergent cooperative behavior, or to know if any such rules exist at all. For such tasks, machine learning techniques like evolutionary computation (EC) may prove a valuable approach to searching the space of possi-ble rule combinations. This paper presents an application of genetic programming to search for foraging behaviors. The learned foraging behaviors use only pheromone information to find the path to the nest and to the food source.},
