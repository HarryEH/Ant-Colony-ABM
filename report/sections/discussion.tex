\section{Discussion}

% Refernce https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00303545 here (adding to refs.bib to be done), comparing the success of the colony
% against the success of examined colonies in that paper at various points in time where the colony is similar to our simulation as current.
% Our system currently says that more major workers are better - this is a change from the stuff recorded in the journal article by Tschinkel (1988) which indicated that only 35% of the workers were majors.
  % This could be because our system does not need to deal with the winter periods, which that same paper shows has a significant effect on the number of major workers, a setback our system never has to deal with.

% List of assumptions we can talk about
% - Whenever we're comparing about the article by Tschinkel, we've gotta remember that his article was based on _fire ants_ not all ants.
% - food decays in the real world (though over a long period of time, so perhaps not as relevant to our own system.)

% Might be worth talking about how our system relates to the work cited in the introduction, particularly a_panait_ant_2004 and `An agent-based model of collective nest choice by the ant Temnothorax albipennis'
